- [ ] Add autocomplete to field values based on same name field in other files.

## Incompatibilities
- This plugin is not compatible with the [Various Complements](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/) with the "Complement automatically" setting turned on (see [#2](https://github.com/dsarman/better-inline-fields/issues/2)).

## Attributions
- The settings suggest input uses code from [obsidian-periodic-notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)
